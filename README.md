# DirectoryDiff
### A simple program that checks for difference in file names in two directories.
DirectoryDiff is a simple program i hacked together when my family asked me to look through two similar 50gb folders of pictures and see if there are any diffrences between them. DirectoryDiff simply looks for files or folders whose names don't match and reports them to you, offering to copy them.
